title: Handy scopes for associations

If your Rails project has a has-many association and you want a way of finding records that have no associated records, or,
records that have at least one associated record, you might find this post useful.

Suppose you have classes `Person` and `Friend` that are associated via a `has_many` relationship:

    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :friends
    end

    class Friend < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :person
    end

How do you find `persons` that have no `friends`?

    Person.includes(:friends).where("friends.person_id IS NULL")

Or that have at least one `friend`

    Person.includes(:friends).where("friends.person_id IS NOT NULL")

#### Using Arel

To accomplish this with Arel
set up the following scopes on `Friend` (thanks to [@macfanatic](http://twitter.com/macfanatic) for the tip),

    class Friend
      belongs_to :person

      scope :to_somebody, ->{ where arel_table[:person_id].not_eq(nil) }
      scope :to_nobody,   ->{ where arel_table[:person_id].eq(nil) }
    end

And then, Persons who have at least one friend:

    Person.includes(:friends).merge(Friend.to_somebody)

The friendless:

    Person.includes(:friends).merge(Friend.to_nobody)

*Note:* If you are on Rails 4 don't forget to append `references(:friends)` to these.
